# Speech-To-Text

To explain this project, I watch this guy called "Coding With Patel" he made a Voice To Text generator, and since all of his code is open source I thought I should jump in and try to help, due to his poor English and misspelt words, the website didn't look the best, so after getting some additional help and redoing everything. I added a couple of things.

Added: Live Text Generator, Added Grammar Support, Fixed Some Issues With Permissions, Changed Text Names To Make Sense, Added Black Background, Made Dynamic Stuff lol.
